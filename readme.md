## What

    This is a professional porfolio template plage that can be customzied very easily. It uses flexbox css and html.
     Included are 2 media query breakpoints. Through dedication and hard work I can keep this maintained and use a
     version of it for myself. All html and CSS is commented structurally so all code is east to decipher.
